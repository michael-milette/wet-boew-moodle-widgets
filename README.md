# WET-BOEW-Moodle-Widgets
This Moodle course contains a list of WET-BOEW working examples to demonstrate which widgets are compatible with the WET-BOEW-Moodle themes (v4.0.30).

There are still some widgets that have yet to be added.

This is just for demonstration purposes. No promises on compatibility are made.
